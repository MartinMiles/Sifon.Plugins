# Sifon Plugins

A collection of plugins to work with Sifon which installs into you version of Sifon once you select Plugins -> Get Sifon plugins

Despite each of these plugins is individual PowerShell commandlet that can work on its own, its real power comes from receiving a profile parameters from calling Sifon application and execiting in its context.
